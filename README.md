About my project on machine learning --> Python | NLP analysis of Restaurant reviews
Natural language processing (NLP) is an area of computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It is the branch of machine learning which is about analyzing any text and handling predictive analysis.
Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. Scikit-learn is largely written in Python, with some core algorithms written in Cython to achieve performance. Cython is a superset of the Python programming language, designed to give C-like performance with code that is written mostly in Python.

This algorithm can be easily applied to any other kind of text like classify a book into Romance, Friction.
